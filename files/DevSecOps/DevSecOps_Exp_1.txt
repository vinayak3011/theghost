Experiment 1


Aim: Perform Version control for different files/directories using GIT. 


Lab Outcome: 
By the end of this experiment, the student will be able to: 
• Understand the core concepts of Git and version control. 
• Initialize a Git repository and track changes to files and directories. • Stage and commit changes with proper messages. 
• Create and merge branches to manage development workflows. 
• Work with remote repositories (e.g., GitHub) to collaborate on code. 


 Learning Objectives: 
• To understand the need and benefits of version control systems. 
• To learn basic and intermediate Git commands for file tracking and collaboration. 
• To gain hands-on experience in managing source code using Git in real-time. 
• To understand Git branching, merging, conflict resolution, and remote repository interaction. 


 Requirement:
 Hardware/Software Requirements:
 • A computer system with internet connectivity 
• Git installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
• GitHub (or similar) account
 • Text Editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code) 


Related Theory: 


* What is Git? 
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle projects of any size with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a codebase simultaneously. 


* Why Version Control? 
• Tracks history of files and directories
• Allows collaborative development 
• Prevents loss of code 
• Enables experimentation via branching 
• Helps in code reviews and audits 




* Common Git Terminology: 
• Repository (repo): A project tracked by Git. 
• Staging area: A space where changes are prepared before committing.
• Commit: A snapshot of the project at a point in time. 
• Branch: A separate line of development. 
• Merge: Combining branches together. 
• Remote: A repository hosted on a server like GitHub.




Program & Output


Install Git


Windows
1. Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Download Git for Windows.

3. Run the installer:

   * Keep default options (select “Use Git Bash” and “Add Git to PATH”).

      4. Open Git Bash (search “Git Bash” in Start menu).

Linux 
Open terminal and run below commands: 
         *     sudo apt update
         # updates package lists.


         *     sudo apt install git -y
# installs Git without asking for confirmation.


         *     git --version
          # verify installation; Displays the installed Git version


 




Procedure / Commands to be Executed
           
            Open terminal and run below commands(only bulleted points are commands).
1. Configuration
         * git config --global user.name "admin"
Sets your global Git username for all repositories on your system.


         * git config --global user.email "admin@gmail.com"
Sets your global email ID that appears in commits.


         * git config --list
Displays all Git configuration settings currently active.


________________


2. Repository Initialization
         * cd desktop
Changes the current working directory to the Desktop.


         * mkdir devsec
Creates a new folder named devsec.


         * cd devsec
Creates a new folder named devsec.


         * git init
Initializes a new empty Git repository in the current folder. It creates a hidden .git directory to track changes.
	________________


3. Add & Commit Files
         * echo "Hello Git" > file1.txt
Creates a new file named file1.txt containing the text Hello Git.

         * git add file1.txt
Stages the file file1.txt for the next commit. (Moves it from “unstaged” to “staged” area.)
	

         * git status
Displays the current state of the repository — which files are staged, modified, or untracked.


         * git commit -m "Initial commit"
Saves the staged files permanently into the local repository with a message. Each commit represents a snapshot of your project.


________________


4. Add Another File and Commit
         * echo "My word" > file2.txt


         * git add .
Stages all modified and new files in the current directory for commit.


         * git status
         * git commit -m "second commit"


________________


5. Reset to Previous Commit
         * git reset --hard HEAD~1
Rolls back the repository to the previous commit, discarding all changes after it.
	



________________


6. Create and Switch Branch
         * git branch new_feature
Creates a new branch named new_feature for parallel development.


         * git checkout new_feature
Switches the working directory to the new_feature branch.


         * git branch
Lists all branches in the repository and shows the currently active one (*).


________________


7. Add and Commit New File on Branch
         * echo "new change" > file3.txt
         * git add .
         * git status
         * git commit -m "my commit 1"


________________


8. Reset Branch Back to Previous Commit
         * git reset --hard HEAD~1


________________


9. Check Commit History
         * git log
Displays the commit history — author, date, and message of each commit.


________________


10. Create and Switch to ‘main’ Branch
         * git checkout master
Switches from the current branch back to the master branch.


         * git branch main
Creates a new branch called main (often the default main branch).
         * git checkout main
Switches to the main branch to continue work there.


________________


11. Add Remote Repository
             
            Login to Github account, create new repository and copy it’s URL
      (eg: https://github.com/admin/devsecops).


         * git remote add origin https://github.com/admin/devsecops
Links the local repository with a remote GitHub repository named origin.


         * git remote -v
Displays the URLs of remote repositories linked to the project (for fetch & push).


Output:
origin  https://github.com/admin/devsecops (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/admin/devsecops (push)


________________


12. Make Local Changes and Use Stash
         * echo "Temporary change not ready to commit" >> file1.txt
Adds text to file1.txt without committing, to demonstrate stash.


         * git status


Output:
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified: file1.txt


Now save the local changes temporarily using stash:
         * git stash
Temporarily saves (stashes) local changes that are not yet ready to be committed, and reverts files to the last commit..


Output:
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: Initial commit


To apply back the stashed changes:
         * git stash pop
Restores (applies) the most recently stashed changes back into the working directory.


________________


13. Push to Remote Repository
         * git push -u origin main
Uploads your local commits to the main branch of the remote GitHub repository and sets it as the default upstream.
________________


14. Verify Commit History
         * git log
         * git dif




Conclusion: 
In this experiment, we explored the usage of Git for version controlling files and directories. We learned how to initialize a Git repository, add and commit files, create and merge branches, and push code to a remote repository. These operations are essential for collaborative software development and ensure smooth and organized tracking of changes in a project.
