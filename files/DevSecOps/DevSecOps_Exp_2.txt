● Use GitHub to host and manage repositories. 
● Connect local repositories to GitHub using HTTPS or SSH. 
● Perform Git operations to sync local and remote repositories. 
● Use Git cheat sheet for efficient version control. 
● Collaborate with others using pull requests and forks. 


Learning Objectives: 
● Understand how GitHub enhances Git functionality with remote hosting. 
● Learn to sync changes between local and remote repositories. 
● Explore collaborative development using GitHub features. 
● Apply cheat sheet commands to perform Git operations efficiently. 
● Resolve conflicts during merges and pull requests. 


Requirement: 
Hardware/Software Requirements: 
● Internet-enabled computer 
● Git installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
● GitHub account (https://github.com) 
● Git cheat sheet (Download from: GitHub Git Cheat Sheet PDF) 
● A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime) 


Related Theory: 
What is GitHub? 
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git for version control and enables developers to store, manage, and track their code repositories. 


Why use GitHub with Git? 
● Code backup and remote access 
● Collaboration and contribution 
● Issue tracking and project management 
● Pull Requests for code reviews 
● Hosting open-source and private projects 


Common Git + GitHub Workflow:  
1. Create a repository on GitHub 
2. Clone the GitHub repo to local 
3. Make changes locally 
4. Add and commit changes 
5. Push changes to GitHub 
6. Create and merge branches 
7. Pull latest changes from GitHub 



Procedure and Output




Step 1: Install Git


Windows
1. Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Download Git for Windows.

3. Run the installer:

   Keep default options (select “Use Git Bash” and “Add Git to PATH”).

      4. Open Git Bash (search “Git Bash” in Start menu).

Linux 
Run below commands: 
             sudo apt update
             sudo apt install git -y
             git --version


# # sudo apt update → updates package lists.

# # sudo apt install git -y → installs Git without asking for confirmation.


# # git --version→  verify installation; Displays the installed Git version




Step 2: Configure Git


         git config --global user.name "Your Name"
         git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"


# # Stores your username and email globally for all repositories.

# # Used to identify you as the author of commits.


         3. git config --list

# # To check configuration


Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub


         On GitHub → click New Repository.

         Name it e.g. devsecops-Exp2.

         Do not initialize with a README (keep it off, we’ll add locally).

         Click Create repository.

         Copy the HTTPS URL,


Step 4: Clone the Remote Repository
Open terminal and paste below commands: 

            cd Desktop
            mkdir Practical
            cd Practical 


            git clone https://github.com/username/devsecops-exp2.git (paste copied URL)
# Makes a local copy of the GitHub repository.


            cd devsecops-Exp2
# Moves into particular local folder.




Step 5: Create and Edit a File
                        echo "# ExDevSecOps Experiment 2" > README1.md
# Creates a new file named README1.md and writes text inside it.




Step 6: Add and Commit the File


            git add README1.md
# stages the file (prepares it for commit).


            git commit -m "Added README1.md"
            # saves the staged change to the repository with a message.




Step 7: Push the Commit to GitHub
            git push origin main
# Uploads your local commits from branch main to remote repository named origin.


Step 8: Create and Switch to a New Branch


            git checkout -b new
# Creates a new branch called new and switches to it in one step.


Step 9: Create Another File on the New Branch


            echo "New branch created" > new.txt
# Creates a new file
            git add new.txt
# Stages the new file


            git commit -m "Added new file"
# Commits file to new branch 


Step 10: Push, pull the New Branch to GitHub


            git push origin new
# Sends the new branch and its commits to GitHub so others can see or merge them.




Step 11: Sync / Pull Updates 


            git pull origin main
# Downloads and merges the latest changes from the remote main branch into your local one.




Step 12: View Commit Log


            git log --oneline 
# Shows all commits for a quick history.




Step 13: Check Repository Status


            git status
# Displays current working directory status 






Conclusion: 
In this experiment, learned how to sync local Git repositories with GitHub effectively. The steps involved cloning a remote repository, committing and pushing changes, pulling updates, and managing branches using Git commands. The use of the Git cheat sheet enhanced efficiency during operations. GitHub was observed as a powerful collaborative platform that supports remote version control, making it essential for modern software development and team-based workflows.
