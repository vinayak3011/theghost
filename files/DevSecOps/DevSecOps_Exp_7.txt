DevSecOps Exp 7

Aim: create Application and code security testing using snyk.



Steps to perform
open kali
# Open your Kali Linux VM/installation (start the machine or open the OS).

open terminal
# Open a terminal window to run all following commands.

	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
# Update APT package lists and upgrade installed packages to latest available versions.

	sudo apt install -y curl git ca-certificates build-essential
# Install essential utilities: curl (download), git (VCS), ca-certificates (TLS trust), and build tools.

	sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
# Install Node.js runtime and npm package manager (needed for Snyk CLI and Node projects).

	node -v
# Print the installed Node.js version to verify installation.

	npm -v
# Print the installed npm version to verify installation.

	sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip
# Install Python 3, virtual environment support, and pip (Python package manager).

	python3 -m venv ~/snyk-venv
# Create an isolated Python virtual environment at ~/snyk-venv for Python tooling.

	source ~/snyk-venv/bin/activate
# Activate the Python virtual environment so pip installs go inside it.

	pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
# Upgrade pip and setuptools inside the venv to latest versions for reliability.

	sudo apt install -y docker.io
# Install Docker engine (required if you plan to scan container images).

	sudo systemctl enable --now docker
# Enable Docker to start on boot and start the Docker service now.

	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Add your user to the 'docker' group so you can run docker without sudo (log out/in required).

	sudo npm install -g snyk
# Install Snyk CLI globally using npm (quick and common install method).

	snyk --version
# Verify Snyk CLI installed correctly by printing its version.

	curl -L https://downloads.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-linux -o snyk
# Download the Snyk standalone Linux binary (alternative to npm install).

	chmod +x snyk
# Make the downloaded Snyk binary executable.

	sudo mv snyk /usr/local/bin/snyk
# Move the Snyk binary into a system PATH location so you can run 'snyk' from anywhere.

	snyk --version
# Verify the Snyk binary is installed and print the version.

	snyk auth
# Authenticate the Snyk CLI to your Snyk account (opens a browser for OAuth login).

	mkdir snyk-lab-node && cd snyk-lab-node
# Create a test Node project directory and change into it.

	npm init -y
# Generate a default package.json for the Node project (auto answers).

	npm install express lodash
# Install example dependencies (express web framework and lodash utility library).

	npm install debug@2.6.9
# Intentionally install an older version of 'debug' (example vulnerable dep) for demo scans.

	snyk test
# Run a local Snyk vulnerability scan for the project and show found issues in the terminal.

	snyk monitor
# Send a snapshot of the project to Snyk's cloud to track the project over time and view results in the web UI.




*****************Q N A************************


1️⃣ Q: What is the objective of this experiment?

A: The objective is to perform application and code security testing using Snyk, a tool that identifies and helps fix vulnerabilities in application dependencies, code, containers, and configurations.

2️⃣ Q: What is DevSecOps?

A: DevSecOps is the integration of security practices into DevOps processes, ensuring that security is implemented from the early stages of software development through automation and continuous monitoring.

3️⃣ Q: What is Snyk and how does it work?

A: Snyk is a developer-first security tool that scans for known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies, container images, and IaC files. It uses a vulnerability database to detect issues and suggests remediations or upgrades.

4️⃣ Q: Why is dependency scanning important?

A: Because most modern applications use third-party packages that might contain known vulnerabilities, dependency scanning ensures all imported libraries are secure and up to date.

5️⃣ Q: Why do we run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade before starting?

A: It ensures all system packages are up to date, preventing compatibility or security issues during the installation of new tools.

6️⃣ Q: What is the purpose of installing Node.js and npm in this experiment?

A: Node.js provides the runtime environment, and npm is used to install Snyk CLI and manage dependencies for the demo Node.js project.

7️⃣ Q: What is the function of snyk auth?

A: This command authenticates the Snyk CLI with the user’s Snyk account through browser login (GitHub, Google, or email), allowing scans to be performed.

8️⃣ Q: What is the difference between snyk test and snyk monitor?

A:

snyk test → Performs a local scan and shows vulnerabilities immediately.

snyk monitor → Uploads a snapshot of the project to Snyk for continuous monitoring and notifications.

9️⃣ Q: Why did we install debug@2.6.9 in our project?

A: That version of debug contains known vulnerabilities; it’s used deliberately so Snyk can detect and report it during the scan.

🔟 Q: What kind of vulnerabilities can Snyk detect?

A: Snyk detects vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, Prototype Pollution, Denial of Service, and insecure dependencies in open-source libraries.

11️⃣ Q: What is the purpose of creating a virtual environment using python3 -m venv?

A: It isolates Python dependencies so that package versions and Snyk testing do not interfere with system-wide installations.

12️⃣ Q: Can Snyk only test Node.js applications?

A: No. Snyk supports multiple languages and environments including Python, Java, Go, .NET, Docker, and Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.).

13️⃣ Q: What is the .snyk policy file used for?

A: It stores ignored vulnerabilities, project-specific settings, and policies that control which issues should be excluded from scans.

14️⃣ Q: What are the advantages of using Snyk in DevSecOps pipelines?

A:

	Early vulnerability detection

	Continuous monitoring of dependencies

	Automatic remediation suggestions

	Integration with CI/CD tools (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

15️⃣ Q: What is the overall conclusion of this experiment?

A: The experiment demonstrates how Snyk integrates security testing into the development lifecycle, automatically detecting vulnerabilities in code and dependencies — promoting secure coding practices within DevSecOps pipelines.
