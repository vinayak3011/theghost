EXP 1 OSINT
1.1 Aim: Perform Email Header Analysis for extracting valuable information like sender IP address, email servers, and routing information

Step 1
	open browser
	login into your gmail acc
	select any random email
	in that email at top right there will be three dots
	click them n then click on show original a new tab will open 

Step 2
	in that new tab there will be copy to clip board button click it 

step 3
	open this website
	   https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx
	paste the copied content there
	click on analyse header 

Step 4
	go through the whole page and analyze it

Q1. What is an Email Header?
Ans:
An email header is a section of an email that contains hidden metadata about the message, such as sender and receiver details, message ID, routing information, timestamps, and authentication results. It helps trace how the email traveled from the sender to the receiver.


Q2. What kind of information can we extract from an email header?
Ans:
From an email header, we can extract:

Sender’s IP address

Mail server path (Received lines)

Message-ID

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication results

Date and time stamps

Email routing delay between servers



Q3. How do you view the email header in Gmail?

Ans:

Open the email.

Click on the three vertical dots (⋮) beside the “Reply” button.

Select “Show Original.”

The new tab will display the raw email header, which can be copied for analysis.



Q4. How can we view the email header in Outlook (Web)?

Ans:

Open the email.

Click on “…” (More Actions) → “View Message Source.”

The complete raw header will appear in a new window.

Copy it for further analysis.



Q5. What does the “Received” field indicate in the email header?

Ans:
Each “Received” field shows the hop or mail server that processed the email.
The topmost “Received” line represents the receiver’s server, and the bottommost line usually contains the sender’s original IP address.



Q6. What is the importance of the sender’s IP address?

Ans:
The sender’s IP address helps identify the actual origin of the email, even if the sender’s name or address is spoofed. It can be traced to a location or organization using IP lookup tools.



Q7. What is SPF in an email header?

Ans:
SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks whether the sender’s mail server is authorized to send emails for that domain. If it passes, the email is likely genuine; if it fails, the email may be spoofed.



Q8. What is DKIM?

Ans:
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) uses cryptographic signatures to verify that the email content was not altered during transmission and that it genuinely comes from the claimed domain.



Q9. What is DMARC?

Ans:
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is a protocol that combines SPF and DKIM to define how receiving mail servers should handle messages that fail authentication (e.g., reject, quarantine, or allow).



Q10. Why do we analyze email headers in cybersecurity?

Ans:
Email header analysis helps in:

Tracing the real sender of an email

Detecting phishing, spam, or spoofed emails

Investigating email-based cybercrimes

Understanding routing paths and delays




Q11. Which online tools can be used to analyze email headers?

Ans:
Some commonly used tools are:

MXToolBox Email Header Analyzer

Google Message Header Analyzer

AnalyzeHeaders.com



Q12. What does it mean if SPF or DKIM fails?

Ans:
If SPF or DKIM fails, it indicates that the email might have been sent from an unauthorized server or tampered with during transmission — a possible sign of phishing or spoofing.



Q13. What is the “Message-ID” field used for?

Ans:
The Message-ID is a unique identifier automatically generated by the mail server. It helps in tracking, identifying duplicates, and referencing specific emails in investigations.



Q14. How can you trace the location of the sender?

Ans:
You can use the sender’s IP address found in the first “Received” line and check it using tools like:

https://ipinfo.io/

https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-lookup

These tools display the geographical location, ISP, and organization of the sender’s IP.



Q15. What is the significance of analyzing the routing path?

Ans:
The routing path shows the sequence of mail servers the email passed through. It helps identify delays, bounces, or suspicious intermediate servers that may have been used in spam or spoofing attempts.
