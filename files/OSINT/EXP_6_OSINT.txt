EXPERIMENT NO. 6: Tactical Information Gathering using OSINT Tools


6.1 Aim
Using OSINT tools gather Tactical information using WHOIS lookup tools or websites like
Domain Tools (domain, registration details, owner’s contact information, registration date,
and expiration date.) Archives, Text, Reverse Image Search, Images and EXIF data, Source
code, Others TLD, Mentions of target, Check info such as via RSS, SSL certificates,
Robots/Sitemap, Port scans, Reverse IP lookup.


6.2 Course Outcome
Demonstrate digital footprint and geospatial profiling using OSINT tools.


6.3 Learning Objectives

6.4 Requirements
Operating System: Windows or Linux
Internet Connection: Required
Tools/Platforms Used:
● who.is / DomainTools — WHOIS lookup
● ViewDNS.info — Reverse IP, Port Scan, DNS lookup
● crt.sh — SSL certificate enumeration
● archive.org — Website history
● Shodan.io — Port and service scan
● Spyse or Censys.io — Infrastructure discovery
● VirusTotal — Domain reputation
● Command line: whois, nslookup, dig, nmap


6.5 Related Theory
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of collecting information from publicly
available sources for investigative or analytical purposes.
Tactical OSINT focuses on extracting technical and infrastructure-level data — such as
domain registration, IP ownership, server configurations, SSL/TLS information, and port
scanning results — to understand how a digital entity operates.
Key concepts include:
Technique Purpose
WHOIS Lookup Provides domain owner, registrar, registration and
expiration dates.
Reverse IP Lookup Finds other domains hosted on the same server.
Port Scan Identifies open ports and running services on a host.
SSL Certificate Lookup Lists certificate issuers, domains covered, and
validity dates.
Website Archives (Wayback
Machine)
Shows historical versions of a website.
Robots.txt/Sitemap.xml Reveals hidden or unindexed web paths.
Source Code Inspection Detects framework, analytics IDs, or links to
external services.
All data collected must respect ethical and legal guidelines; no unauthorized access or
exploitation is permitted.

6.6 Program and Output:

1) WHOIS Lookup — domain registration details
Purpose: returns registrar, creation/expiry dates, name servers, and public contact blocks (if available).

COMMAND:  whois youtube.com

Notes: Output varies by TLD/registrar. Look for Registrar:, Creation Date:, Registry Expiry Date:, Name Server:.






2) DNS & Name Server Investigation — A/AAAA/MX/TXT/NS records
Purpose: list DNS records and delegated name servers (used to determine mail hosts, IPs, TXT/SPF, and authoritative NS).

COMMAND :
# A record
dig +noall +answer testphp.vulnweb.com A
# AAAA (IPv6)
dig +noall +answer testphp.vulnweb.com AAAA
# MX (mail exchange)
dig +noall +answer testphp.vulnweb.com MX
# TXT (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, other text records)
dig +noall +answer testphp.vulnweb.com TXT
# NS (authoritative name servers)
dig +noall +answer testphp.vulnweb.com NS


Notes: +noall +answer shows just the answer section. Use dig @ns1.example.com ... to query a specific nameserver.








3) Web Archive (Wayback Machine) — historical snapshots
Purpose: view prior versions of pages to find removed content or historical changes.

WORKING :  
Open: http://web.archive.org/
Search for: testphp.vulnweb.com  (use the site search box)


Notes: browse snapshots by date; useful for content discovery and timeline analysis.






4) Reverse Image Search & EXIF extraction

Purpose: find where an image appears online and extract embedded metadata (camera, GPS, timestamps).
Steps (example):

# 1. Download any image to a folder  (https://www.pic2map.com/) 

# 2. Extract EXIF metadata
exiftool (england-london-bridge.jpg) > exif_output.txt                (replace your image name)


Notes: exiftool outputs GPS, camera model, date/time, software. Many social sites strip EXIF; reverse-image search (Google/ Bing/ Yandex) helps find other copies.





5) Image Geolocation
Purpose: if EXIF contains GPS coordinates, you can geolocate the photo. exiftool already shows GPS fields.

COMMAND:
# display just GPS fields
exiftool -gps* (england-london-bridge.jpg)                (replace your image name)


Notes: If GPS exists, copy lat/long into Google Maps. If no GPS, use visual geolocation (landmarks) combined with reverse-image results.





6) Source Code & Resource Enumeration (Browser DevTools)
Purpose: inspect loaded JS/CSS, endpoints, API calls, and hidden resources. No single command — use the browser.
Steps:

WORKING:
Open target in browser (Chrome/Firefox).
Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I → use the Network, Sources, Console, and Application tabs.


Notes: Look for API endpoints, JavaScript variables, XHR/Fetch calls, and static assets. Use Ctrl+F to search source for interesting strings (e.g., api, token, endpoint).





7) Mentions & OSINT Harvesting (theHarvester)
Purpose: collect email addresses, subdomains, hosts and mentions from public sources.

COMMAND:
# Example: harvest with Bing and save HTML report
theHarvester -d testphp.vulnweb.com -b bing -f outputs/theharvester_bing.html


Notes: -d domain, -b data source (bing, google, linkedin, etc.), -f output file. Use benign targets only.




8) Robots.txt / Sitemap / RSS — fetch and quick grep
Purpose: discover disallowed paths, sitemap links, and RSS/Atom feeds (useful for hidden URLs and content feeds).

COMMANDS:

# robots.txt
curl -s https://testphp.vulnweb.com/robots.txt | tee outputs/robots_testphp.txt
# sitemap
curl -s https://testphp.vulnweb.com/sitemap.xml | tee outputs/sitemap_testphp.xml
# quick grep for RSS/Atom links from homepage
curl -s https://testphp.vulnweb.com | grep -iE "application/(rss|atom)|<link[^>]+(rss|atom)|sitemap"


Notes: robots.txt lists disallowed paths (not authoritative but useful). Sitemap often contains URLs for crawling. RSS/Atom feeds expose timely content.




9) SSL Certificate Inspection — retrieve and inspect cert details
Purpose: examine certificate issuer, validity dates, subject, and SANs (useful for domain ownership and expiry checks).

COMMANDS:

# fetch cert and save
echo | openssl s_client -connect testphp.vulnweb.com:443 -servername testphp.vulnweb.com 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -text > outputs/cert_testphp.txt
# quick grep for Subject Alternative Name in the saved file
grep -i "Subject Alternative Name" -A3 outputs/cert_testphp.txt || true


Notes: check Not Before/Not After dates, Issuer, and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries. -servername sends SNI.




10) Port Scan (nmap) — quick and extended scans (lab only)
Purpose: discover open services and versions. Only use on permitted targets.


COMMANDS:
# Top-100 TCP ports with service/version detection
nmap -sV --top-ports 100 -oN outputs/nmap_testphp_top100.txt testphp.vulnweb.com
# If allowed and in lab: ports 1-1000 with version detection
nmap -sV -p 1-1000 -oN outputs/nmap_testphp_1_1000.txt testphp.vulnweb.com


Notes: -sV probes for service/version; -oN saves normal output. For stealth or timing, adjust -T and flags.






11) Reverse IP / Resolve and reverse DNS lookup
Purpose: resolve domain to IP, then reverse lookup to find PTR records and other hostnames sharing the IP.

# Resolve A record and save IP
dig +short example.com > outputs/example_ip.txt
# Read the IP into a variable and write a one-line summary
IP=$(cat outputs/example_ip.txt)
echo "IP: $IP" | tee outputs/ip_summary_example.txt
# Basic reverse DNS (PTR) lookup and append to summary
host "$IP" | tee -a outputs/ip_summary_example.txt


Notes: dig +short gives just IP(s). host shows PTR records. For reverse IP hosting lists (other domains on same IP), use online reverse IP tools or run nmap --script=http-vhosts cautiously.






6.7 Conclusion
In this experiment, I used various OSINT tools to perform tactical intelligence gathering on
a target domain. By combining WHOIS data, DNS lookups, SSL certificate details, and port
scans, I successfully profiled the target’s digital infrastructure. Archive and source-code
inspection revealed historical and technical insights, while VirusTotal confirmed the domain’s
reputation.
This exercise demonstrated how OSINT can map a domain’s digital footprint, providing
valuable situational awareness while emphasizing the importance of ethical use and data
validation.
