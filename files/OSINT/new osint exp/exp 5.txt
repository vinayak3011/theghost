Aim: Identify valid corporate email addresses from public sources and document their data exposure risk.

Tools:

Tool 1: Kali Linux Terminal (for theHarvester)

Tool 2: Web Browser (for Hunter.io)

Tool 3: A plain text editor (like Notepad, gedit)

Step-by-Step Guide
Part 1: Find the "Email Footprint" (using theHarvester)

Open Kali Linux and open the Terminal.

To find the entire footprint, you will search all sources at once. Type any one command below
	theHarvester -d sakec.ac.in -b all
	theHarvester -d nist.gov -b all
	theHarvester -d infosectrain.com -b all
	theHarvester -d tesla.com -b all				

Press Enter and wait. This will search Google, Bing, LinkedIn, etc., to find as many emails as possible for your target.

This list of all the emails you found is the "email footprint".

if mam ask for specific like yahoo or linkedin just replace the all with whatever she ask
	(for yahoo theHarvester -d infosectrain.com -b all ---> theHarvester -d infosectrain.com -b yahoo)



Part 2: Identify Valid Emails (using Hunter.io)

Open your Web Browser and go to https://hunter.io/.

Log in. On the gray menu bar on the far left, click on "Verifier".

Copy the email you found in Part 1 (with theHarvester) and paste them one-by-one into the "Verifier" box.

Click "Verify" for each one.

Make a note of every email that comes back as "Valid".
