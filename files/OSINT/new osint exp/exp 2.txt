2. A company reports delayed email deliveries. You are asked to
extract the routing path from the email header and identify which
mail server caused the delay based on timestamp analysis.


🧪 New Experiment 2: Find Email Delays
Aim: Extract the routing path from an email header and identify which mail server caused a delay.

Tools:

An email (like in your second picture)

Web Browser

MXToolbox Header Analyzer



Step-by-Step Guide


Part 1: Get Your Email Header

Open an email in your email account.

Click the three dots (⋮) on the top-right.

Click "Show Original".

A new tab will open with the messy "Raw Header" (this is your second image).

Click the "Copy to clipboard" button.



Part 2: Analyze the Header

Open a new browser tab.

Go to the website:
 https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx.

Paste your copied header into the big text box.

Click the "Analyze Header" button.



Part 3: Find the Delay (Using Your Table)

The tool will show you a report. Scroll down until you see the "Routing Path" table. 

Look at the column named Delay.

Find the row that has the biggest number (the longest time).

("0 seconds", which means the email was super fast. In a different email, you might see "10 minutes" or "300 seconds".)

In that same row with the biggest delay, look at the server name in the From column.

That From server is the one that caused the delay. It held the email for a long time before sending it to the By server.
