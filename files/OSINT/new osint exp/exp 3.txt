The tool will show you a report. Scroll down to the section that shows the "Routing Path" table (the same table from your picture with Hop, Delay, From).

This table IS the email's journey. It shows every server the email "hopped" through to get to you.

	(Received-SPF: pass (google.com: domain of bounce-4673_html-377684140-12674-546007459-108350@bounce.s13.mc.pd25.com designates 128.245.247.83 as permitted sender) client-ip=128.245.247.83;)
