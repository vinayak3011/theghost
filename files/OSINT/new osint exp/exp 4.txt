🧪 New Experiment 4: Enumerate Emails with theHarvester & Hunter.io
Aim: Enumerate possible email addresses for the domain infosec.edu and verify their existence.

Tool 1: Kali Linux Terminal

Tool 2: Web Browser

Step-by-Step Guide

Part 1: Find Emails with theHarvester

Open Kali Linux and open the Terminal.

To complete the experiment, type the main command and press Enter:

	theHarvester -d infosec.edu -b google

Wait for the tool to finish. It will show you a list of any emails (like name@infosec.edu) and subdomains it found.

If your examiner asks for more examples, you are ready. Show them these other commands from your notes to prove you know the tool well:

To search a different domain (like your college):
	theHarvester -d sakec.ac.in -b yahoo

To search for employee names on LinkedIn:
	theHarvester -d nist.gov -b linkedin

To search with a limit (so it's faster):
	theHarvester -d nist.gov -b google -l 100 -v

To search another domain:
	theHarvester -d infosectrain.com -b yahoo



Part 2: Verify Emails with Hunter.io

Open your Web Browser (on Windows or Kali).

Go to the website:
 https://hunter.io/

Log in (or create your free account). 
On that screen, look at the gray menu bar on the far left side.

Click on the word "Verifier". (it is the fifth word down, just under "Finder").

A new box will appear. 

Paste that email into the "Verifier" box.(give random email there u can use ur sakec email)

Click the "Verify" button.

The tool will check the email and tell you if its status is "Valid", "Invalid", or "Risky". This confirms if the email exists.
