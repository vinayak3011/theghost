1. The cybersecurity team received a suspicious email claiming to
be from the university’s IT department. You are tasked to analyze
its email header to:
● Identify the actual sender’s IP address,
● Verify if the email passed SPF/DKIM checks, and
● Determine if the email was spoofed.


🧪 New Experiment 1: Analyze Header for IP and Spoofing
Aim: Identify the actual sender’s IP address, verify if the email passed SPF/DKIM checks, and determine if the email was spoofed.

Tools:

Gmail (or any email account)

Web Browser

MXToolbox Header Analyzer (the one you prepared for) 


Step-by-Step Guide

Part 1: Get Your Email Header

Open Gmail and log in.

Select any email you want to test (like a newsletter or spam).

Inside the email, find the three dots (⋮) on the top-right, next to the "Reply" button.

Click the three dots, then click "Show Original".

A new browser tab will open. Click the "Copy to clipboard" button.



Part 2: Analyze the Header

Open a new browser tab.

Go to the website:
 https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx.

You will see a big text box. Paste your copied header into this box.

Click the "Analyze Header" button.



Part 3: Find the Answers

The website will show you a simple report.

To find the Sender IP: Look for the row that says "Sender IP" or "Originating IP". That's your first answer.

To check SPF/DKIM: Look at the test results. You will see rows for SPF and DKIM.


To see if it's spoofed:

If you see SPF: Pass and DKIM: Pass, the email is probably real and NOT spoofed.

If you see SPF: Fail or DKIM: Fail, it is a very strong sign that the email IS spoofed.
