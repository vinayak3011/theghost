Experiment 3

3.1 Aim: Analyze the metadata of an email, including date and time stamps, email clients
used, originating IP address, email’s origin, potential geographic location of the sender, and
possible email routing.

3.2 Course Outcome (CO):
Apply OSINT tools for passive information gathering to identify potential vulnerabilities in
cybersecurity.

3.3 Learning Objective:
Analyze email headers for identifying the sender's origin, email client, timestamps, and
routing details.

3.4 Requirements:
• Sample email with full header
• Tools:
o MXToolbox Header Analyzer
o Google Email Header Analyzer
o Manual inspection in a text editor
• Internet connection
• Optional: IP location lookup tools like IPLocation.net

3.5 Theory:
Email headers contain detailed metadata used in cybersecurity and forensic investigations.
These include:
• Date and Time Stamps: Timestamp when the email was sent/received.
• From / To / CC / BCC: Email addresses involved.
• Subject: Content topic.
• Message-ID: A globally unique ID for email tracking.
• Return-Path: Where non-delivery notifications (bounces) go.
• Received Fields: Shows the path the email took across mail servers (last to first).
• X-Originating-IP: IP address of sender’s device (sometimes available).
• User-Agent / X-Mailer: Email client used to compose/send the email.


3.6 Procedure:
1. Obtain a Sample Email:
o Export or copy the full email header from your email client (e.g., Gmail →
"Show Original").

2. Use Online Header Analyzers:
o Paste the full header into MXToolbox or Google Toolbox.
o Analyze:
▪ Delivery time
▪ Sender IP
▪ Mail servers passed through
▪ User-Agent (Client used)

3. Manual Analysis (Optional):
o Paste the header into a text editor.
o Look for:
▪ Received: lines (track server path, reverse order).
▪ Date: and Message-ID:
▪ X-Originating-IP: or X-Mailer: if present.

4. Determine Sender Location:
o Copy the originating IP and paste it into IPLocation.net.
o Note the geographic location and ISP.
5. Document all observations such as:
o Date/Time email was sent
o Source IP and location
o Email client used
o Routing path via mail servers


3.7 Results: 

3.8 Conclusion: In this experiment, we successfully extracted and analyzed the metadata of an email using
both online tools and manual inspection. We identified crucial information such as the
sending IP address, email client, timestamps, and the routing path of the email. This metadata
is vital in digital forensics and OSINT investigations for tracing the origin of phishing, spam,
or spoofed emails








WORKING: 

Step 1: Get a Sample Email Header

Open your email account (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo).
Choose any email message.
In Gmail: Click three dots (⋮) next to “Reply” → click “Show Original.”
A new tab opens with the full email header and body.Copy everything from the header section (before the email content).Save it in a text file, e.g., email_header.txt.


Step 2: Analyze Using Online Tools

Option 1: MXToolbox
Go to 👉 https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx
Paste your copied header into the textbox.
Click “Analyze Header.”
The tool will display:
Email routing path
Delay between mail servers
Originating IP
Email client used

Option 2: Google Admin Toolbox
Visit 👉 https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/
Paste the same header.
Click “Analyze the Header.”
View:
Delivery time
Server hops
Sender’s domain/IP


Step 3: Find Sender’s Geographic Location
Copy the originating IP address found in Step 2 or 3.
Visit 👉 https://www.iplocation.net/
Paste the IP address and click “Find.”
Note:
Country, City
ISP or Organization name


Step 5: Document Your Observations
Create a small result table (example):
Parameter	Observation
Date & Time Sent	18 Oct 2025, 10:42 AM
Source IP	192.0.2.15
Sender Location	California, USA
Email Client	Outlook 16.0
Routing Path	smtp.example.com → mail.google.com → yourmailserver.com
